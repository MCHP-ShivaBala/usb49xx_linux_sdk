1) Introduction
===============

This application is meant for programming the external SPI flash of a
USB491x/471x series USB hub. The tool also supports a limited number of SPI
Bridging commands. This application makes use of libusb APIs to perform low level
SPI pass-through transfer read/writes. The features supported are as follows:

    (i) Programming the SPI flash with a binary file
    (ii) Reading the contents of the flash into a binary file.
    (iii)Safe boot from Internal ROM in case of operation failure.
    (iv) SPI pass-through read and write.

NOTE: This example was developed to work with Microchip/SST flash only. It has
not been tested with other third-party flash memories. Using it with a third-
party flash may produce unpredicatable results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)Pre-requisites
===============

(i) Software:
    ----------
   Linux OS
   libusb 1.0
   MPLABConnect.a

(ii) Hardware:
    ----------
	USB491x/471x.
	USB2.0 host controller.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Getting Started
==================

Prior to running this application, connect the USB491x/471x series hub to the
host and ensure that it is enumerated. This can be checked by using

    $ lsusb

    Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0424:2514 Standard Microsystems Corp. USB 2.0 Hub
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 006 Device 002: ID 2109:0812 VIA Labs, Inc. VL812 Hub
    Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 005 Device 003: ID 2109:2812 VIA Labs, Inc. VL812 Hub
    Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 413c:2002 Dell Computer Corp. SK-8125 Keyboard
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 413c:1002 Dell Computer Corp. Keyboard Hub
    Bus 001 Device 021: ID 0424:494a Standard Microsystems Corp.
    Bus 001 Device 020: ID 0424:4916 Standard Microsystems Corp.
    Bus 001 Device 080: ID 0461:4d22 Primax Electronics, Ltd


 0424 is Vendor ID(VID) for Microchip(SMSC) hubs. On successful USB491x/471x
 enumeration, you will see 2 devices on the bus: USB2.0 hub(e.g. PID:4916) and
 the Hub feature controller (e.g. PID: 494a).

 This application will uses USB2.0 for all SPI programming and bridging operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Building and Executing
==========================

(i) Firstly, ensure that you have root access privileges on the machine you are
using. If not, run the following command:

    $ sudo su

You will be prompted for the login password.

(ii) In order to clean and build the application, navigate to the MPLABConnect
directory and execute the following commands.

    $ make clean

    rm -f *.o
    rm -f *.a
    rm -f Makefile.bak

    $ make

    =============
    Compiling MchpUSBInterface.cpp
    =============
    Compiling USBHubAbstraction.cpp
    =============
    Creating MPLABConnect.a

(iii) Copy the newly created MPLABConnect.a file to the SPI_Bridging directory
using the following command.

    $ cp MPLABConnect.a ../SPI_Bridging

(iv) Navigate to the SPI_Bridging directory and execute a clean and build using
the commands in step (ii).

    $ make clean

    rm -rf ./obj
    rm -rf ./out
    rm -f Makefile.bak

    $ make

    =============
    Compiling spi_bridging.cpp
    =============
    Creating spiBridging

(v) On a successful build, you should see a folder titled 'out' which shall
have the executable file 'spiBridging'. Navigate to the out folder to execute.


    $cd out

(vi) In order to see the list of supported operations and the command line
arguments, execute with --help flag.


    $ ./spiBridging --help

    Operation : Write
    Usage: ./spiBridging VID(Hex) PID(Hex) DevicePath(String) Operation(0x01) FirmwareFile
    Example: ./spiBridging 0x424 0x4916 "1:2" 0x01 USB49XX_SILICON_SPI_V1.27.bin

    Operation : Read
    Usage: ./spiBridging VID(Hex) PID(Hex) DevicePath(String) Operation(0x00) FirmwareFile
    Example: ./spiBridging 0x424 0x4916 "1:2" 0x00 flash_dump.bin

    Operation : Transfer
    Usage: ./spiBridging VID(Hex) PID(Hex) DevicePath(String) Operation(0x03) Direction(R/W: 1/0) Command DataLength TotalLength
    Example: ./spiBridging 0x0424 0x4916 "1:2" 0x02 0 0x9f 1 4
    Example: ./spiBridging 0x0424 0x4916 "1:2" 0x02 1 0x9f 1 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Troubleshooting
==================

In case of failure, you can enable the DEBUG option to see debug logs in the
console during execution. This can be done by un-commenting the following
statment in the file MchpUSBInterface.h file:

    Line 68: #define DEBUG

Re-compile the application and run it again to see the debug log in the console.
Since a lot of messages are generated during debug, it is advisable to divert the
console output to a text file. This can be done as follows:

    $ <Read/write Command> > log.txt
    Example:

    ./spiBridging 0x424 0x4916 "1:2" 0x01 USB49XX_SILICON_SPI_V1.27.bin > log.txt

In case of verification failure during programming, the data read from the flash
for verification will stored in a file "flash_verify_fail.bin" at
..SPI_Bridging/out , if the executable was compiled with the debug option enabled.
